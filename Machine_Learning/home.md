# What is Machine Learning?


Arthur Samuel in 1959 coined the term Machine Learning as follows :

> It's a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed

Seems old right?

Tom Mitchell in 1998 gave another definition for Machine Learning as follows :

> A computer program is said to learn from Experience 'E' with respect to some task 'T' and some performance measure 'P', if its performance on 'T' as measured by 'P' improves with experience 'E'

Seems confusing??? Let's give you an example :

```
Suppose you have to create a ML model to identify if an email is a spam or not
So in this case
T = Classifiying emails as spam or not
E = ML Model watching you labeling an email as spam
P = Number of times it correctly identified if an email is spam or not
```

We just barely scratched the surface of machine learning. Now you know what is machine learning let's go in more depth.

### Different types of machine learning : 
1. Supervised Learning - In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output. In other terms "Right Answers are given to us"
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning
4. Recommender System

#### Supervised Learning is further classified into 2 types - 
1. Regression Problems - In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. For eg - You want to create a house price prediction ML model. It will try to predict the value of the house based the inputs you provide (Like area of your house). Now this is a contigous function as the output (price) can range from (1 to thousands of Dollars).
2. Classification Problem - In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories. For eg - You want to create a model which will identify if a cancer is malignant or benign. So based on your inputs(Like tumor size etc) it will give either of these outputs only.
