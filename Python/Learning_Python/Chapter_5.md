# Numeric Types

### Numeric Type Basics

In Python, numbers are not really a single object type, but a category of similar types. Python supports the usual numeric types (integers and floating points), as well as literals for creating numbers and expressions for processing them. In addition, Python provides more advanced numeric programming support and objects for more advanced work. A complete inventory of Python’s numeric toolbox includes:
1. Integer and floating-point objects
2. Complex number objects
3. Decimal: fixed-precision objects
4. Fraction: rational number objects
5. Sets: collections with numeric operations
6. Booleans: true and false
7. Built-in functions and modules: round, math, random, etc.
8. Expressions; unlimited integer precision; bitwise operations; hex, octal, and binary formats
9. Third-party extensions: vectors, libraries, visualization, plotting, etc.

# Test Your Knowledge

### Q1 - Name four of Python’s core data types.

```
Numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples, files, and sets are generally considered to be the 
core object (data) types. Types, None, and Booleans are sometimes classified this way as well. 
There are multiple number types (integer, floating point, complex, fraction, and decimal) and 
multiple string types (simple strings and Unicode strings in Python 2.X, and text strings and byte 
strings in Python 3.X).
