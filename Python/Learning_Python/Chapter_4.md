# How You Run Programs

### Starting an Interactive Session

Simplest way to run Python programs is to type them at Python’s interactive command line, sometimes called the interactive prompt. The most platform-neutral way to start an interactive interpreter session is usually just to type python at your operating system’s prompt, without any arguments.

```python
% python
Python 3.3.0 (v3.3.0:bd8afb90ebf2, Sep 29 2012, 10:57:17) [MSC v.1600 64 bit ...
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> ^Z
```
Anytime you see the ">>>" prompt, you’re in an interactive Python interpreter session. You can type any Python statement or expression here and run it immediately.

# Test Your Knowledge

### Q1 - How can you start an interactive interpreter session?

```
You can start an interactive session on Windows 7 and earlier by clicking your Start button, picking 
the All Programs option, clicking the Python entry, and selecting the “Python (command line)” menu 
option. You can also achieve the same effect on Windows and other platforms by typing python as a 
system command line in your system’s console window (a Command Prompt window on Windows). Another 
alternative is to launch IDLE, as its main Python shell window is an interactive session. Depending 
on your platform and Python, if you have not set your system’s PATH variable to find Python, you may 
need to cd to where Python is installed, or type its full directory path instead of just python 
(e.g., C:\Python33\python on Windows, unless you’re using the 3.3 launcher)
```
