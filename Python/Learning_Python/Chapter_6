# The Dynamic Typing Interlude

### Numeric Type Basics

In Python, numbers are not really a single object type, but a category of similar types. Python supports the usual numeric types (integers and floating points), as well as literals for creating numbers and expressions for processing them. In addition, Python provides more advanced numeric programming support and objects for more advanced work. A complete inventory of Python’s numeric toolbox includes:
1. Integer and floating-point objects
2. Complex number objects
3. Decimal: fixed-precision objects
4. Fraction: rational number objects
5. Sets: collections with numeric operations
6. Booleans: true and false
7. Built-in functions and modules: round, math, random, etc.
8. Expressions; unlimited integer precision; bitwise operations; hex, octal, and binary formats
9. Third-party extensions: vectors, libraries, visualization, plotting, etc.

# Test Your Knowledge

### Q4 - What tools can you use to find a number’s square root, as well as its square?

```
Functions for obtaining the square root, as well as pi, tangents, and more, are available in the 
imported math module. To find a number’s square root, import math and call math.sqrt(N). To get a 
number’s square, use either the exponent expression X ** 2 or the built-in function pow(X, 2). 
Either of these last two can also compute the square root when given a power of 0.5.
