### Q1 - Name four of Pythonâ€™s core data types.

```
Numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples, files, and sets are generally considered to be the 
core object (data) types. Types, None, and Booleans are sometimes classified this way as well. 
There are multiple number types (integer, floating point, complex, fraction, and decimal) and 
multiple string types (simple strings and Unicode strings in Python 2.X, and text strings and byte 
strings in Python 3.X).
```
