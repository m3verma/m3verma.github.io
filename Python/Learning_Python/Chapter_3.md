# How You Run Programs

### Starting an Interactive Session

Simplest way to run Python programs is to type them at Python’s interactive command line, sometimes called the interactive prompt. The most platform-neutral way to start an interactive interpreter session is usually just to type python at your operating system’s prompt, without any arguments.

```python
% python
Python 3.3.0 (v3.3.0:bd8afb90ebf2, Sep 29 2012, 10:57:17) [MSC v.1600 64 bit ...
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> ^Z
```
Anytime you see the >>> prompt, you’re in an interactive Python interpreter session. You can type any Python statement or expression here and run it immediately.

*   In its simplest form, a python program is just a text file containing python statements.
<br><br>
*   Python program files are given names that end in **.py**

```
Source code is the statements you write for your program—it consists of text in text files that normally
end with a .py extension.
