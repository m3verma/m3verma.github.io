# String Fundamentals

### String Basics

From a functional perspective, strings can be used to represent just about anything that can be encoded as text or bytes. In the text department, this includes symbols and words (e.g., your name), contents of text files loaded into memory, Internet addresses, Python source code, and so on. Python strings are categorized as immutable sequences, meaning that the characters they contain have a left-to-right positional order and that they cannot be changed in place. Common string literals and operations :

| Operation        | Interpretation          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| S = ''           | Empty string |
| S = "spam's" | Double quotes, same as single  |
| S = 's\np\ta\x00m'           | Escape sequences  |
| S = """...multiline..."""           | Triple-quoted block strings |
| S = r'\temp\spam'           | Raw strings (no escapes) |
| B = b'sp\xc4m' | Byte strings in 2.6, 2.7, and 3.X   |
| U = u'sp\u00c4m'           | Unicode strings in 2.X and 3.3+    |
| S1 + S2           | Concatenate, repeat |
| ```S[i]``` | Index   |
| ```S[i:j]```           | Slice    |
| len(S)          | Length |
| "a %s parrot" % kind | String formatting expression   |
| "a {0} parrot".format(kind)           | String formatting method in 2.6, 2.7, and 3.X   |
| S.find('pa')           | String methods (see ahead for all 43): search, |
| S.rstrip() | Remove whitespace,   |
| S.replace('pa', 'xx')           | Replacement    |
| S.split(',')          | Split on delimiter |
| S.isdigit()          | Content test |
| S.lower() | Case conversion   |
| S.endswith('spam')           | End Test   |
| 'spam'.join(strlist)           | Delimiter join |
| S.encode('latin-1') | Unicode encoding   |
| B.decode('utf8')           | Unicode decoding    |
| for x in S: print(x)        | Iteration |

### String Literals

By and large, strings are fairly easy to use in Python. Perhaps the most complicated thing about them is that there are so many ways to write them in your code:

1. Single quotes: 'spa"m'
2. Double quotes: "spa'm"
3. Triple quotes: '''... spam ...''', """... spam ..."""
4. Escape sequences: "s\tp\na\0m"
5. Raw strings: r"C:\new\test.spm"
6. Bytes literals in 3.X and 2.6+ : b'sp\x01am'
7. Unicode literals in 2.X and 3.3+ : u'eggs\u0020spam'

Around Python strings, single- and double-quote characters are interchangeable. That is, string literals can be written enclosed in either two single or two double quotes—the two forms work the same and return the same type of object. The reason for supporting both is that it allows you to embed a quote character of the other variety inside a string without escaping it with a backslash.

```python
>>> 'shrubbery', "shrubbery"
```
> ('shrubbery', 'shrubbery')

Python automatically concatenates adjacent string literals in any expression, although it is almost as simple to add a + operator between them to invoke concatenation explicitly.

```python
>>> title = "Meaning " 'of' " Life"        # Implicit concatenation
>>> title
```
> 'Meaning of Life'

### Escape Sequences

Backslashes are used to introduce special character codings known as escape sequences. Escape sequences let us embed characters in strings that cannot easily be typed on a keyboard. The character \, and one or more characters following it in the string literal, are replaced with a single character in the resulting string object, which has the binary value specified by the escape sequence. For example, here is a five-character string that embeds a newline and a tab :

```python
>>> s = 'a\nb\tc'
```
> 'a\nb\tc'

```python
>>> print(s)
```
> a
> b       c

Python recognizes a full set of escape code sequences :

| Escape        | Meaning          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| \newline | Ignored (continuation line) |
| \\ | Backslash (stores one \) |
| `\'`  | Single quote (stores ') |
| `\"` | Double quote (stores ") |
| \a | Bell |
| \b | Backspace |
| \f | Formfeed |
| \n | Newline (linefeed) |
| \r | Carriage return |
| \t | Horizontal tab |
| \v | Vertical tab |
| \xhh | Character with hex value hh (exactly 2 digits) |
| \ooo | Character with octal value ooo (up to 3 digits) |
| \0 | Null: binary 0 character (doesn’t end string) |
| \N{ id } | Unicode database ID |
| \uhhhh | Unicode character with 16-bit hex value |
| \Uhhhhhhhh | Unicode character with 32-bit hex valuea |
| \other | Not an escape (keeps both \ and other) |

Some escape sequences allow you to embed absolute binary values into the characters of a string. For instance, here’s a five-character string that embeds two characters with binary zero values :

```python
>>> s = 'a\0b\0c'
>>> s
```
> 'a\x00b\x00c'

```python
>>> len(s)
```
> 5

If the letter r (uppercase or lowercase) appears just before the opening quote of a string, it turns off the escape mechanism. The result is that Python retains your backslashes literally, exactly as you type them. Alternatively, because two backslashes are really an escape sequence for one backslash, you can keep your backslashes by simply doubling them up.

```python
>>> myfile = open(r'C:\new\text.dat', 'w')
>>> myfile = open('C:\\new\\text.dat', 'w')
```

### Triple Quotes Code

Python also has a triple-quoted string literal format, sometimes called a block string, that is a syntactic convenience for coding multiline text data. This form begins with three quotes (of either the single or double variety), is followed by any number of lines of text, and is closed with the same triple-quote sequence that opened it. In fact, triple-quoted strings will retain all the enclosed text, including any to the right of your code that you might intend as comments. Triple-quoted strings are useful anytime you need multiline text in your program; for example, to embed multiline error messages or HTML, XML, or JSON code in your Python source code files.

```python
>>> mantra = """Always look
...   on the bright
... side of life."""
>>>
>>> mantra
```
> 'Always look\n  on the bright\nside of life.'

### Strings in Action

You can concatenate strings using the + operator and repeat them using the * operator:

```python
>>> len('abc')            # Length: number of items
```
> 3

```python
>>> 'abc' + 'def'         # Concatenation: a new string
```
> 'abcdef'

```python
>>> 'Ni!' * 4             # Repetition: like "Ni!" + "Ni!" + ...
```
> 'Ni!Ni!Ni!Ni!'

The len built-in function here returns the length of a string. Notice that operator overloading is at work here already: we’re using the same + and * operators that perform addition and multiplication when using numbers. Python does the correct operation because it knows the types of the objects being added and multiplied. But be careful: the rules aren’t quite as liberal as you might expect. For instance, Python doesn’t allow you to mix numbers and strings in + expressions: 'abc'+9 raises an error instead of automatically converting 9 to a string. You can also iterate over strings in loops using for statements, which repeat actions, and test membership for both characters and substrings with the in expression operator, which is essentially a search.

```python
>>> "k" in myjob                        # Found
```
> True

```python
>>> "z" in myjob                        # Not found
```
> False

### Indexing and Slicing

In Python, characters in a string are fetched by indexing—providing the numeric offset of the desired component in square brackets after the string. You get back the one-character string at the specified position. As in the C language, Python offsets start at 0 and end at one less than the length of the string. Unlike C, however, Python also lets you fetch items from sequences such as strings using negative offsets. Technically, a negative offset is added to the length of a string to derive a positive offset. You can also think of negative offsets as counting backward from the end.

```python
>>> S = 'spam'
>>> S[0], S[−2]                         # Indexing from front or end
```
> ('s', 'a')

```python
>>> S[1:3], S[1:], S[:−1]               # Slicing: extract a section
```
> ('pa', 'pam', 'spa')

The last line in the preceding example demonstrates slicing, a generalized form of indexing that returns an entire section, not a single item. The basics of slicing are straightforward. When you index a sequence object such as a string on a pair of offsets separated by a colon, Python returns a new object containing the contiguous section identified by the offset pair. The left offset is taken to be the lower bound (inclusive), and the right is the upper bound (noninclusive).

Indexing `(S[i])` fetches components at offsets:
1. The first item is at offset 0.
2. Negative indexes mean to count backward from the end or right.
3. `S[0]` fetches the first item.
4. `S[−2]` fetches the second item from the end (like `S[len(S)−2]`).

Slicing `(S[i:j])` extracts contiguous sections of sequences:
1. The upper bound is noninclusive.
2. Slice boundaries default to 0 and the sequence length, if omitted.
3. `S[1:3]` fetches items at offsets 1 up to but not including 3.
4. `S[1:]` fetches items at offset 1 through the end (the sequence length).
5. `S[:3]` fetches items at offset 0 up to but not including 3.
6. `S[:−1]` fetches items at offset 0 up to but not including the last item.
7. `S[:]` fetches items at offsets 0 through the end—making a top-level copy of S.

In Python 2.3 and later, slice expressions have support for an optional third index, used as a step. The full-blown form of a slice is now `X[I:J:K]`, which means “extract all the items in X, from offset I through J−1, by K.” The third limit, K, defaults to +1, which is why normally all items in a slice are extracted from left to right. For instance, `X[1:10:2]` will fetch every other item in X from offsets 1–9; that is, it will collect the items at offsets 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.

```python
>>> S = 'abcdefghijklmnop'
>>> S[1:10:2]                          # Skipping items
```
> 'bdfhj'

```python
>>> S[::2]
```
> 'acegikmo'

```python
>>> S = 'hello'
>>> S[::−1]                            # Reversing items
```
> 'olleh'

### String Conversion Tools

You cannot add a number and a string together in Python, even if the string looks like a number.

```python
>>> "42" + 1
```
> TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly

What to do, then, if your script obtains a number as a text string from a file or user interface? The trick is that you need to employ conversion tools before you can treat a string like a number, or vice versa. The int function converts a string to a number, and the str function converts a number to its string representation.

```python
>>> int("42"), str(42)          # Convert from/to string
```
> (42, '42')

On the subject of conversions, it is also possible to convert a single character to its underlying integer code (e.g., its ASCII byte value) by passing it to the built-in ord function—this returns the actual binary value used to represent the corresponding character in memory. The chr function performs the inverse operation, taking an integer code and converting it to the corresponding character :

```python
>>> ord('s')
```
> 115

```python
>>> chr(115)
```
> 's'

### Changing Strings

Remember the term “immutable sequence”? As we’ve seen, the immutable part means that you cannot change a string in place—for instance, by assigning to an index:

```python
>>> S = 'spam'
>>> S[0] = 'x'                 # Raises an error!
```
> TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment

How to modify text information in Python, then? To change a string, you generally need to build and assign a new string using tools such as concatenation and slicing, and then, if desired, assign the result back to the string’s original name :

```python
>>> S = S + 'SPAM!'            # To change a string, make a new one
>>> S
```
> 'spamSPAM!'

```python
>>> S = S[:4] + 'Burger' + S[−1]
>>> S
```
> 'spamBurger!'

### String Methods

In addition to expression operators, strings provide a set of methods that implement more sophisticated text-processing tasks. In Python, expressions and built-in functions may work across a range of types, but methods are generally specific to object types—string methods, for example, work only on string objects. String methods in Python :

| Functions        | Functions          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| S.capitalize() | `S.ljust(width [, fill])` |
| S.casefold() | S.lower() |
| `S.center(width [, fill])` | `S.lstrip([chars])` |
| `S.count(sub [, start [, end]])` | `S.maketrans(x[, y[, z]])` |
| `S.encode([encoding [,errors]])` | S.partition(sep) |
| `S.endswith(suffix [, start [, end]])` | `S.replace(old, new [, count])` |
| `S.expandtabs([tabsize])` | `S.rfind(sub [,start [,end]])` |
| `S.find(sub [, start [, end]])` | `S.rindex(sub [, start [, end]])` |
| `S.index(sub [, start [, end]])` | S.rpartition(sep) |
| S.isalnum() | `S.rsplit([sep[, maxsplit]])` |
| S.isalpha() | `S.rstrip([chars])` |
| S.isdecimal() | `S.split([sep [,maxsplit]])` |
| S.isdigit() | `S.splitlines([keepends])` |
| S.isidentifier() | `S.startswith(prefix [, start [, end]])` |
| S.islower() | `S.strip([chars])` |
| S.isnumeric() | S.swapcase() |
| S.isprintable() | S.title() |
| S.isspace() | S.translate(map) |
| S.istitle() | S.upper() |
| S.isupper() | S.zfill(width) |
| S.join(iterable) | `S.rjust(width [, fill])` |

# Test Your Knowledge

### Q1 -  Consider the following three statements. Do they change the value printed for A?

```python
A = "spam"
B = A
B = "shrubbery"
```
```
No: A still prints as "spam". When B is assigned to the string "shrubbery", all that happens is 
that the variable B is reset to point to the new string object. A and B initially share 
(i.e., reference/point to) the same single string object "spam", but two names are never linked 
together in Python. Thus, setting B to a different object has no effect on A. The same would be 
true if the last statement here were B = B + 'shrubbery', by the way—the concatenation would make 
a new object for its result, which would then be assigned to B only. We can never overwrite a 
string (or number, or tuple) in place, because strings are immutable.
```
