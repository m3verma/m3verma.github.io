# Getting Started with pandas

## Pandas

It contains data structures and data manipulation tools designed to make data cleaning and analysis fast and easy in Python. pandas is often used in tandem with numerical computing tools like NumPy and SciPy, analytical libraries like statsmodels and scikit-learn, and data visualization libraries like matplotlib. pandas adopts significant parts of NumPyâ€™s idiomatic style of array-based computing, especially array-based functions and a preference for data processing without for loops.
