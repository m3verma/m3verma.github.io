# Python Language Basics, IPython, and Jupyter Notebooks

## The Python Interpreter

Python is an interpreted language. The Python interpreter runs a program by executing one statement at a time. The standard interactive Python interpreter can be invoked on the command line with the python command. Running Python programs is as simple as calling python with a .py file as its first argument. Suppose we had created hello_world.py with these contents :

```python
print('Hello world')
```

You can run it by executing the following command (the hello_world.py file must be in your current working terminal directory) :

```python
$ python hello_world.py
```
> Hello world
