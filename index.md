## Hi,

```
“The beautiful thing about learning is that nobody can take it away from you.” – B.B. King
```

I am a learner just like you, and I thought why to learn alone when we all can learn together.


The things I am currently working on :

1. [Machine Learning](https://m3verma.github.io/Machine_Learning/home) - A one stop shop to everything I learnt about Machine Learning
2. [Python](https://m3verma.github.io/Python/home) - A programming language I used for Machine Learning
3. [Programming](https://m3verma.github.io/Programming/home) - A series of Competitive programming problem solutions
4. [Natural Language Processing](https://m3verma.github.io/NLP/home) - A one stop shop to everything I learnt about Natural Language Processing
5. [MTech Journey](https://m3verma.github.io/MTECH/home) - Subjects and Books I followed during my MTech Journey
